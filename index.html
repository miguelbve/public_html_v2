			<h1>Life Science</h1>
				<p>
				Biological researchers collect and analyse a high amount
				of different types of scientific data, including DNA, RNA,
				amino acid sequences, in situ and microarray gene
				expression data, protein structures, biological pathways,
				biological signals and images of diverse origin. In
				recent years, the study systems biology and
				a wealth of bioinformatics applications in the
				fields of basic and applied life sciences has changed the
				paradigm of both research and exploitation of knowledge.

			<h1>Life Science & Technology (LST)</h1>
				<p>
				The main difference between genomics and genetics is that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and 
				composition of the single gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships in 
				order to identify their combined influence on the growth and development of the organism.		
				Bioinformatics tools aid in the comparison of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the 
				understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. Systems Biology is the field in
				which an integrated, quantitative analysis is performed to study the mechanisms by which cellular 
				components, cells, organisms and communities interact in space and time.

				Modern studies in life sciences generates large amounts of data and is therefore highly dependent on advanced computer science.
				Bioinformatics is the application and development of technologies from computer science to solve challenges within biology
				such as the disciplines molecular biology and medicine. At a more integrative level, it helps 
				analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology.
